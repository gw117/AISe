How to setup the quantum AI dev kit. on your android smartphone install droidscript and download AISe from my github page. extract all files to the root directory of your phone. rename Quantum AI.js as Quantum ai.txt, then open the Quantum AI.txt file in a notepad copy all text, then make a new app in droidscript and overwrite all the example code of the new app by pasting the quantum AI code. then select run to test.to setup the quantum engine module. you need an arduino, a polarising strip, a 3.3 volt laser, a breadboard and some breadboard wires.

Setup so the laser shines through the polarising strip and the point ends up on a surface somewhere.

Secure the smartphone so it can observe the laser point on the surface while the app is running.

Press start on the app.
Test by using an arduino 5v, 3.3v and ground pins. to trigger a 5 volt pulse to initiate the Quantum AI and paradox. Then use a series of on and off pulses of 3.3 volts. keep on alternating on and off. and you should notice some data in the upper left hand side of the app interface. keep on alternating. until you see several stars in the data...

Then close the app using task manager and reenter the app, (the app saves the random seed nonce everytime those stars appear and loads them at appliction run)afterwards press send, you could press send without exiting although it takes much longer because the camera detection is running.

Then you should see the AI now operate.
