Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Communication
Communication skills are important to everyone - they are how we give and receive information and
convey our ideas and opinions with those around us.
Communication comes in many forms:
•

verbal (sounds, language, and tone of voice)

•

aural (listening and hearing)

•

non-verbal (facial expressions, body language, and posture)

•

written (journals, emails, blogs, and text messages)

•

visual (signs, symbols, and pictures)

Communication skills are ranked FIRST
among a job candidate’s “must have”
skills and qualities, according to a
2010 survey conducted by the National
Association of Colleges and Employers.

It is important to develop a variety of skills for both communicating TO others and learning how to
interpret the information received FROM others. Knowing our audience and understanding how they
need to receive information is equally important as knowing ourselves.
To an employer, good communication skills are essential. In fact, employers consistently rank good
communication skills at the top of the list for potential employees.
During an interview, for example, employers are impressed by a job candidate who answers questions
with more than one-word answers (such as yeah…nah…dunno), demonstrates that he or she is listening,
and shares information and ideas (by asking questions for clarification and/or follow-up). The
interview can be an indication to employers of how the candidate or employee will interact with
supervisors, co-workers, and customers or resolve conflicts when they arise. Remember, non-verbal
communication is also critical in an interview. Employers expect good eye contact, good posture, and
“active” listening.
One of the challenges in the workplace is learning the specific communication styles of others and how
and when to share your ideas or concerns. Though some supervisors may specifically ask for your
opinion, others may assume if there is something important they need to know, you will bring it to
their attention – or if there is something you are unsure about, you will ask. Knowing how to listen
carefully and when to ask for help is important. If an employee and a supervisor learn to communicate
well (in whatever method that works), there is a greater likelihood of job retention and promotion.
The activities in this section will not only help participants practice and recognize how they provide
information to others, but also help them consider how others may prefer to receive information. It is
important to reinforce with participants that communication skills involve give and take – and they
can, indeed, be learned and strengthened over time.

Note to facilitators: Communication skills are necessary for the development of self-advocacy and
self-determination, important skills for lifelong success. To that end, the activities in this section
offer many opportunities for youth to practice communicating their strengths and assets while
learning how to minimize any perceived barriers to employment. Please take the opportunity to add
to or tweak any of the activities to better focus on the needs of your particular group.
For example, if working with youth with disabilities, create opportunities to practice communicating
how, when, and to whom to disclose a disability on the job or in post-secondary education and/or
different ways to communicate a request for a reasonable accommodation. If you support youth
involved in the juvenile justice system, enhance this section’s extension activities to include
practicing how to communicate the proactive changes they are making in their lives, what they have
learned from previous experiences, and how any mistakes of the past have helped them to become
more focused and dedicated young adults.

1. Whats’ Your Point?
JUST THE FACTS: This activity helps participants understand the importance of being specific when offering
and receiving communication. Often times our meaning gets lost, twisted, or misunderstood because we
haven’t been specific enough in our communication or we haven’t asked clarifying questions. These role plays
are designed to demonstrate the value of being specific in communication…TO others and in what is received
FROM others.

Time

20 minutes

Materials
•

A few copies of Activity 1 (at least one copy per volunteer actor/actress).

•

Costumes and other props, if possible.

Directions

Ask for volunteers to act out a short role play. Each skit requires two people: one
employee and one supervisor.
In the first role play, Jade has a job mowing lawns and receives some not-so-positive
feedback from Mr. Z., a client.
In the second role play, Will works at a dentist’s office and has gotten into some trouble
with his boss, Ms. T.
Suggestion: Encourage participants to ad-lib, or improvise, if they feel comfortable. Giving youth
permission to ad-lib often makes activities more “real” and memorable. In addition, youth may wish
to retry one or more of the skits and create their own characters.

After each skit is read, ask the following questions:
•

Role Play #1: How did Jade handle Mr. Z.’s comments? What did she do right? Was
there anything she could have done differently? What about Mr. Z.? What could he
have done differently?

•

Role Play #2: How do you think Ms. T. handled the situation with Will’s lateness? How
did Will handle Ms. T.’s disapproval? What might he have done differently? What might
Ms. T. have done differently?

19

Skills to Pay the Bills

Conclusion

In either of these role-play situations, the employee could have “copped an attitude” or gotten
defensive with the adult. Reread one or both of the activities and act out the situation
differently. What would it have looked and sounded like if Jade had not demonstrated such a
mature attitude? What would it have looked and sounded like if Will hadn’t offered a suggestion
for his situation?
Because each employee remained calm and asked additional questions to get clarity about each
situation, he/she was able to communicate with the other person – and clearly identify the
problem.
Is this easy or difficult for you to do in most situations? If it’s easy, what are some strategies you
use that help you to “keep your cool”? If it’s difficult, what might you try to do differently?

Journaling Activity

Think about a time when a parent, teacher, or friend criticized you. What happened? How did
this make you feel? How did you handle it? Are you proud of the way you handled it? What
might you do differently if something like this happens in the future? Did this experience
change the way you offer feedback to others?

Extension Activity

Divide the group into smaller groups (no more than four per group). Have participants share (if
they are comfortable) the situation they used for their journal entry. Use the situations to
create and act out new role-play situations for the other groups. Three discussion questions
should be written as well – and discussed as a group. Create three questions to be used with
the larger group after the role-play is acted out.

Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Activity 1. What’s Your Point?
ROLE PLAY #1
Scenario: Jade has her first job mowing lawns. She works for her best friend’s brother who owns a
landscaping company. She’s had the job for about three weeks and really feels like she’s getting into
the groove. In fact, it’s the perfect job for her: she loves being outside and appreciates the fact that
she can work on her own and even listen to her MP3 player! Jade arrives early at Mr. Z.’s house (her
first customer of the day) and gets ready to begin mowing.
Mr. Z.:

You’re finally here!

Jade:

Hi, Mr. Z. Yes, I’m here to mow your lawn.

Mr. Z.:

Well, you didn’t do a very good job last week.

Jade:

		

Mr. Z.:

It was just a mess!

Jade:

		

Mr. Z.:

Well, it looked just awful.

Jade:

	

Mr. Z.:

Well, the cut grass was left on the lawn, and the edges weren’t straight.

Jade:

		

Mr. Z.:

Yes, that is exactly what I expect!

Jade:

		

Mr. Z.:

Thank you very much.

Activity 1. What’s Your Point?
ROLE PLAY #2
Scenario: Will works in a large dental office and winds up rushing to get to work every day after
school. His job tasks include filing, making photocopies, stuffing envelopes, and answering the
telephone. Ms. T, the office manager, has asked to speak with Will about his time sheet.

22

Ms. T.:

Hello, Will. I would like to talk with you.

Will:

Yes, Ms. T.?

Ms. T.:

Will, I’ve been watching your time this week, and I’m quite concerned.

Will:

Ms. T., I see that you’re not happy, but will you please be more specific?

Ms. T.:

You’re not getting here on time.

Will:

I know I’ve been arriving to work late, and I am sorry.

Ms. T.:

Ms. T.:

That would be very helpful. Thank you, Will.

2. Flipping the Switch
JUST THE FACTS: The purpose of this activity is to encourage youth to discuss the different types of
communication they might use in different situations and environments. It introduces the idea that
language/communication varies by context – and that it’s important to understand what might be
acceptable and expected in one setting may not be appropriate in another.

Time

30 Minutes

Materials
•

Activity 2

•

Optional: Flip chart/markers

Directions

Ask participants to describe or demonstrate how they communicate with their
friends. Then ask how they communicate with family members. Finally, ask
how they are likely to communicate with an employer at a job interview.
Discuss the differences and similarities in the participants’ responses. Ask the
group:
•

Why is each situation different?

•

What are the expectations of each person?

•

What would happen if you greeted your friends in the way you greeted an
interviewer?

•

What would happen if you greeted an interviewer the same way you greet
your friends?

Knowing how to communicate with people in the right context for a given
situation is an important skill, as there are often unspoken rules and standards
that are just expected. For example, it’s common practice in the professional
world to shake hands with people when meeting, rather than offering a highfive or a hug. We might use slang with our friends when talking about what
happened at school or at a party, but we would usually use different words and
mannerisms when telling our parents the same information.
Use Activity 2 to compare and contrast the differences in how we might share
the same type of information to different groups.

23

Skills to Pay the Bills

Conclusion

Discuss the following ideas with participants, encouraging an honest dialogue:
1.

When the group changes, does the message change? Why or why not?

2.

What are some examples of communication (both verbal and non-verbal) that you
should always try to practice when communicating with an employer? How would
your friends react to you if you communicated with them in the same way you
would to an employer?

Journaling Activity

We all communicate differently with different people in our lives. Does the way you
communicate (or say things) affect how others perceive you? Explain.

Extension Activity

We build great relationships by learning to become great communicators. This is not
always an easy task as we sometimes may experience barriers to communication –
especially in the workplace. Take some time to explore with the group the following
eight barriers. Think about what they are and ways in which these barriers can be
lessened or eliminated for successful communication. The facilitator may wish to
emphasize the importance of non-verbal communication skills, as young people often
overlook these skills.

3. Oh, Puh-leeeeeeze!
JUST THE FACTS: The purpose of this activity is to help youth gain a better understanding of how
non-verbal communication (both intended and unintended) can be interpreted by others…and the
impact and effect of this form of communication.

Time

20 minutes

Materials

• Activity 3 (words and/or pictures cut out)

Directions

Ask participants if they have ever gotten caught rolling their eyes at a teacher, parent,
co-worker, or supervisor? Ask for a show of hands. Whether you rolled your eyes
intentionally or didn’t even realize you did it, how do you think your action was
interpreted? Answers will vary but might include: I’m bored, you are really annoying,
yeah right, I’m sooooo not interested in what you are saying or doing.
There are all types of communication. Believe it or not, the type that uses no words is
the kind that is the most important. When it comes to communication, what people SEE
is often more memorable than what they read or hear. This is often referred to as body
language. Body language includes facial expressions, eye behavior, gestures, posture,
and more. Body language can express your emotions, feelings, and attitudes. It can even
contradict what you say verbally! People in different cultures may understand some
global non-verbal expressions, while other expressions may be culture specific.
If the participants are from many different cultures, ask if they can give an example of
non-verbal communication cues specific to their culture.
Cut out the words in Activity 3, fold each and place in a hat, bowl, or bag. Ask each
person in the group to take one piece of paper. Using body language and facial
expressions only, ask each person to demonstrate this emotion, while others try to guess
it. As an alternative, you can download "emoticons" and have participants match or
identify what each picture describes. Continue until all words or pictures have been
used/guessed.

26

Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Conclusion

Read the following statement to the group: ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.
Then ask:
•

How many have heard this expression? When/where?

•

What does it mean?

•

How is this possible when actions do not “speak”?

Journaling Activity

Many people dream of being successful, but their actions can sometimes hold them back.
What are some ways you can be sure that your actions help you to achieve your goals in life?

Extension Activity

Consider the following seven types of non-verbal signals and cues we often use to
communicate our interest in and to others. Create a list of Do’s and Don’ts for avoiding
common body language mistakes on the job.
1.

Facial expressions: The human face is extremely expressive, able to convey
countless emotions without saying a word. And unlike some forms of non-verbal
communication, facial expressions are universal. The facial expressions for
happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust are the same across cultures.

2.

Body movements and posture: Consider how your perceptions of people are
affected by the way they sit, walk, stand up, or hold their head. The way you move
and carry yourself communicates a lot of information to the world. This type of
non-verbal communication includes your posture, bearing, stance, and subtle
movements.

3.

Gestures: We wave, point, plead, and often use our hands when we are arguing or
speaking in an animated way. However, the meaning of gestures can be very
different across cultures and regions, so it’s important to be careful to avoid
misinterpretation.

4.

Eye contact: Since the visual sense is dominant for most people, eye contact is an
especially important type of non-verbal communication. The way you look at
someone can communicate many things, including interest, affection, hostility, or
attraction. Eye contact is also important in maintaining the flow of conversation and
for assessing another person’s response.

5.

Touch: We communicate a great deal through touch. Think about the messages
given by the following: a firm handshake, a timid tap on the shoulder, a warm bear
hug, a reassuring pat on the back, a patronizing pat on the head, or a controlling
grip on your arm.

27

Skills to Pay the Bills

6.

Space: Have you ever felt uncomfortable during a conversation because the
other person was standing too close and invading your space? We all have a need
for physical space, although that need differs depending on the culture,
situation, and closeness of the relationship. You can use physical space to
communicate many different non-verbal messages, including signals of intimacy,
aggression, dominance, or affection.

7.

Voice: We communicate with our voices, even when we are not using words.
Non-verbal speech sounds such as tone, pitch, volume, inflection, rhythm, and
rate are important communication elements. When we speak, other people
“read” our voices in addition to listening to our words. These non-verbal speech
sounds provide subtle but powerful clues into our true feelings and what we
really mean. Think about how tone of voice, for example, can indicate sarcasm,
anger, affection, or confidence.

28

Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Activity 3. Oh Puh-leeeeze! (Words)
Directions: There are many creative ways to complete this activity. A few suggestions include:
•

Write each of the following words on an index card (or print and cut out words). Fold each card
and place into a bowl, hat, or bag. Students can pick a word and attempt to act it out for the
group. For students who read Braille, use a Braille printer to be sure the word can be read and
understood by all.

•

Write words on sticky notes or sentence strips and place around the room. Act out the emotion and
see if participants can guess and move to the right one.

•

Say the word out loud and have participants draw what this emotion looks like to them. Share with
the group.

•

Download "emoticons" (or find pictures) that represent each emotion. Participants can match picture
to word.

4. Listen Hear!!
JUST THE FACTS: This quick activity is designed to get participants to start thinking about the importance of two-way communication.

Time

15 - 20 minutes

Materials
•

One sheet of paper (8-1/2 x 11) for each participant

•

One sheet of paper for the facilitator

Directions

After giving each participant one sheet of paper, offer the following directions, pausing
after each instruction to give the group time to comply (complete the activity yourself
using your own sheet of paper).
1.

Pick up your sheet of paper and hold it in front of you. Close your eyes and
listen carefully to my directions. The rules are: (1) no peeking and (2) no
questions.

2.

The first thing I want you to do is to fold your sheet of paper in half. (Pause)

3.

Now, tear off the upper right hand corner. (Pause)

4.

Fold the paper in half again and tear off the upper left hand corner of the sheet.
(Pause)

5.

Fold it in half again. (Pause)

6.

Now tear off the lower right-hand corner of the sheet. (Pause)

After all tearing is complete, say:
Now, open your eyes and unfold your paper. If I did a good job of communicating and
you did a good job of listening, all of our sheets should look exactly the same!
Hold your sheet up for everyone to see. Ask participants to compare their sheets. Ask
why no one’s paper matched yours exactly? You will probably get responses such as,
“You didn’t let us ask any questions!” or “The way you gave us directions wasn’t clear!”

Conclusion

Part of the communication process (and being a good communicator) is recognizing that
people may need to receive information in different ways in order to be successful. If
the goal of this activity was really to have everyone’s snowflakes look exactly the same,
what changes could have been made to the directions?

30

Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Discuss the need for effective two-way communication at home, at work, and in the
community with friends. Ask the group to work together or in smaller groups to create
a definition of “Good Communication” by thinking about what good communication
looks like. Be sure the list includes the responsibilities of being a good communicator
and a good listener.

Journaling Activity

Think of a time when you could have been a better communicator or a better listener.
Describe the situation. What happened? What is more important – communicating in
a way that is easy for you or communicating in a way so that others can understand
you? Is there a difference? Explain.

Extension Activity

Talk about the different TV shows participants watch. Discuss the differences in the
way people communicate (or don’t communicate) with each other – and how
miscommunication has caused problems and conflict for the show’s characters. Select
a conflict from a recent TV episode and have participants describe, discuss, or act out
how the problem was solved/portrayed in that scene.
Consider: What was the conflict? What strategies did the characters use to solve the
problem? Were they effective strategies for solving the problem solving peacefully? If
not, what strategies might the characters have used instead? Discuss the effect young
people think the media has on how people handle their problems?
Finally, create a TV public service announcement that promotes solving conflicts in
peaceful ways.
*You may also wish to check with your local Department of Juvenile Services or other social
services agency and find out about conflict mediation specialists in your area. Invite them in to
talk with the group about conflict – and ways to handle unhealthy situations before they get out
of control.

5. Quit Talkin’! I Know What To Do!
JUST THE FACTS: The purpose of this activity is to discuss the importance of understanding
directions before you start a task. Participants will examine the pros and cons of different types of
direction – and decide which type of direction they are most comfortable with and how to receive
that type of direction as often as possible.

Time

15 minutes

Materials
•

One copy of Activity 5 for each participant

•

Stop watch or watch with second hand

Directions

This activity can either be completed independently or in groups of two.
Say: For this activity, you will have three minutes to complete a short quiz. I’m
going to pass out these papers and ask you to not look at them until I say so.
When I say “go,” you will have three minutes exactly to do what is asked of you
on this paper. Ready, Get Set, Go!

Conclusion

Discuss with the group how they felt about this activity? Was it fun, frustrating,
easy, or difficult? What aspects of the activity made it so? What is the moral or
message of this lesson? How does this message relate to work?

Journaling Activity

Give an example of a time when you really thought you knew what you were
supposed to do but did not. What happened?

Extension Activity

Consider all of the different ways directions can be offered and how they can be
collected or received. Think about people who might have difficulty reading the
English language or understanding the spoken word. What are some different ways
the instructions could have been given to ensure EVERYONE understood?

32

Mastering Soft Skills for Workplace Success

Next, have students think about how they learn best (if possible, complete a basic learning
styles assessment). Are they primarily visual learners, auditory learners, or hands-on/
kinesthetic learners? Consider ways in which you might let someone know what type of
learner you are before getting information. Think about school or a job. How might you
be proactive in helping a teacher or a supervisor understand how you need to be taught?
Share strategies with the group.
